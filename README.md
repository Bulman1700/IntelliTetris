Welcome to IntelliTetris!

This project is still in the process of being complete. However, the Board class and the Piece class are all fully operational, and the test cases for__ those compile and run. Soon there will be a working game of tetris, and then after that I plan on creating a AI interface that can assist the__ user in placing the piece in the right spot.__ 

To compile and run a test test case (either boardtestcases or piecetestcases), type the following into the command line:__
        -- javac [board/piece]testcases/TestCase0x.java__
        -- java [board/piece]testcases/TestCase0x__
        __
        replace x with the file you want to run.__
