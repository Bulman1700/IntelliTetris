Welcome to IntelliTetris!

This project is still in the process of being complete. However, the Board class and the Piece class are all fully operational, and the test cases for those compile and run. Soon there will be a working game of tetris, and then after that I plan on creating a AI interface that can assist the user in placing the piece in the right spot. 

To compile and run a test test case (either boardtestcases or piecetestcases), type the following into the command line:
        -- javac [board/piece]testcases/TestCase0x.java
        -- java [board/piece]testcases/TestCase0x

        replace x with the file you want to run.
