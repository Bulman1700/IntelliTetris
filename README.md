Welcome to
## IntelliTetris!

This project is still in the process of being complete. However, the Board class and the Piece class are fully operational, and the test cases for <br /> those compile and run.

To compile and run a test test case (either boardtestcases or piecetestcases), type the following into the command line:<br />
        -- javac [board/piece]testcases/TestCase0x.java<br />
        -- java [board/piece]testcases/TestCase0x<br /><br />

replace x with the file you want to run.
