Welcome to
## IntelliTetris!

This project is still in the process of being complete. However, the Board class and the Piece class are all fully operational, and the test cases for <br /> those compile and run. Soon there will be a working game of tetris, and then after that I plan on creating a AI interface that can assist the <br /> user in placing the piece in the right spot.<br /><br />

To compile and run a test test case (either boardtestcases or piecetestcases), type the following into the command line:<br />
        -- javac [board/piece]testcases/TestCase0x.java<br />
        -- java [board/piece]testcases/TestCase0x<br /><br />

replace x with the file you want to run.

## Big Update!

I have accidentally made the Board class slightly buggy. I am in the process of making more in depth test cases. Hopefully soon I can sort out the board class so I can then move on to actually making the game.
