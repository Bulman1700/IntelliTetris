Welcome to IntelliTetris!

This project is still in the process of being complete. However, the Board class and the Piece class are all fully operational, and the test cases for those compile and run. Soon there will be a working game of tetris, and then after that I plan on creating a AI interface that can assist the user in placing the piece in the right spot.
